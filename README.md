  ### Installation

  To access the social network API, run: npm start from the command line in a terminal from the main directory of the application. Open Insomnia to test API routes on localhost:3001.

  ### Usage

The foundation of social networking platforms is data, so this exercise is intended to show how to build and structure the API first.


  ### Tests

Tests for the API routes can be run through Insomnia. Create, Read, Update, and Delete Users and their Friends, Thoughts and their Reactions.

  ### Notes

At the time of submission, routes contain errors.
